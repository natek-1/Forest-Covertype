# Forest Cover Classification

This project classifies forest cover types using cartographic variables. We employ machine learning models such as SVM and XGBoost, including hyperparameter tuning, to predict cover types in the Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado.

## Introduction

The Forest Cover Classification project uses machine learning to predict forest cover types based on cartographic features, enhancing our understanding of ecological processes in minimally disturbed wilderness areas.

## Project life cycle
Forest Cover Type Prediciton

* Understanding the Problem Statement
* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data Pre-Processing
* Model Training and hyper parameter tuning
* Model selection


## Problem Statement
* The data is from 4 wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. The wilderness areas are:
1. Rawah Wilderness Area
2. Neota Wilderness Area
3. Comanche Peak Wilderness Area
4. Cache la Poudre Wilderness Area
The observation are taken from 30m x 30m patches of forest that are classified as one of seven cover types
1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Cottonwood/Willow
5. Aspen
6. Douglas-fir
7. Krummholz


## Dataset Information

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Forest Cover Type Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype)
- **Region:** Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado
- **Variables:** Cartographic variables (no remotely sensed data)
- **Independent Variables:** Derived from USGS and USFS, including binary columns for qualitative data (wilderness areas and soil types)
