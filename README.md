# Forest Cover Classification

This project classifies forest cover types using cartographic variables. We employ machine learning models such as SVM and XGBoost, including hyperparameter tuning, to predict cover types in the Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado.

## Introduction

The Forest Cover Classification project uses machine learning to predict forest cover types based on cartographic features, enhancing our understanding of ecological processes in minimally disturbed wilderness areas.

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Forest Cover Type Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype)
- **Region:** Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado
- **Variables:** Cartographic variables (no remotely sensed data)
- **Independent Variables:** Derived from USGS and USFS, including binary columns for qualitative data (wilderness areas and soil types)
